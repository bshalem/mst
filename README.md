# What is MST?
MST is a hight-quality and sustainable movie review dataset we constructed to study automatic
spoiler detection in social media posts.

The data was scraped from unsolicited tweets and paired with a title caption and meta-data 
we extracted from the rich Internet Movie Database (IMDb).

The dataset is formatted as a pair of collections of movie and tweet json objects, respectively.
